# Stroke-Risk-Analysis-Power-BI-Case-Study
This project analyses healthcare data to identify key risk factors associated with stroke and provide actionable insights to support preventive healthcare decision-making. The analysis is presented through interactive Power BI dashboards designed for both executive and analytical audiences.

# Business Objective
To help healthcare stakeholders:

Identify high-risk populations

Understand key health and lifestyle drivers of stroke

Support early intervention and prevention strategies

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains patient-level information including:

Demographics: age, gender, marital status, residence type

Health indicators: hypertension, heart disease, BMI, average glucose level

Lifestyle factors: smoking status, work type

Target variable: stroke (binary indicator)

# Tools Used
Power BI,
Power Query,
DAX

# Data Preparation
Converted binary indicators (stroke, hypertension, heart disease) into readable categories

Imputed missing BMI values using the median

Renamed columns for clarity and usability

Retained numeric flags for accurate DAX calculations

# Dashboards
# 1. Stroke Risk – Executive Overview

# Purpose: High-level insights for decision-makers
Key KPIs:

Total Patients

Stroke Cases

Stroke Rate (%)

Average Age of Stroke Patients

Includes demographic breakdowns by age, gender, residence type, and marital status.

# 2. Risk Factor Analysis

# Purpose: Identify what drives stroke risk
Key analyses:

Stroke cases by smoking status

Impact of hypertension and heart disease

Key Influencers visual highlighting BMI thresholds

# Key Insights
Stroke risk increases significantly with age (average stroke patient age ≈ 68)

Stroke likelihood rises when BMI exceeds ~23.7

Elevated glucose levels are associated with higher stroke incidence

Lifestyle factors such as smoking have long-term risk implications
