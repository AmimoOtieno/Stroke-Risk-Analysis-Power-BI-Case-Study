# Stroke-Risk-Analysis-Power-BI-Case-Study
This project analyzes healthcare data to identify key risk factors associated with stroke and provide actionable insights to support preventive healthcare decision-making. The analysis is presented through interactive Power BI dashboards designed for both executive and analytical audiences.
Business Objective

To help healthcare stakeholders:

Identify high-risk populations

Understand key health and lifestyle drivers of stroke

Support early intervention and prevention strategies

Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient-level information including:

Demographics: age, gender, marital status, residence type

Health indicators: hypertension, heart disease, BMI, average glucose level

Lifestyle factors: smoking status, work type

Target variable: stroke (binary indicator)

Tools Used

Power BI

Power Query

DAX

Data Preparation

Converted binary indicators (stroke, hypertension, heart disease) into readable categories

Imputed missing BMI values using the median

Renamed columns for clarity and usability

Retained numeric flags for accurate DAX calculations

Dashboards
1. Stroke Risk – Executive Overview

Purpose: High-level insights for decision-makers
Key KPIs:

Total Patients

Stroke Cases

Stroke Rate (%)

Average Age of Stroke Patients

Includes demographic breakdowns by age, gender, residence type, and marital status.

2. Risk Factor Analysis

Purpose: Identify what drives stroke risk
Key analyses:

Stroke cases by smoking status

Impact of hypertension and heart disease

Influence of BMI and glucose levels

Key Influencers visual highlighting BMI thresholds

Key Insights

Stroke risk increases significantly with age (average stroke patient age ≈ 68)

Hypertension and heart disease are strong predictors of stroke

Stroke likelihood rises when BMI exceeds ~23.7

Elevated glucose levels are associated with higher stroke incidence

Lifestyle factors such as smoking have long-term risk implications
